So far adds:
 - 3 Jokers
 - 1 rarity (basically nonfuctional)

   As of now theres no way to access the new jokers! You will have to use DebugPlus to play with them. This is temporary and WILL CHANGE.

   I have big ideas for this project, but its more of a hobby than anything!
   A more abstract roadmap I have is to:
   - Add a story/lore to the mod
   - more jokers, many with their own unique mechanics
   - more probably lol
