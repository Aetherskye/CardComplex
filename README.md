So far adds:
 - 4 Jokers
 - 1 rarity 
 - a texture im not fixing right now im so tired and i want to play deltarune 

   There is now a way to obtain the cards! A special 'placeholder' pack featuring a new character may now appear, containing the new cards. 
   This is a temporary addition to make the 'demo' playable without debugplus.

  Please report any bugs to @Aetherskye on discord!


   I have big ideas for this project, but its more of a hobby than anything!
   A more abstract roadmap I have is to:
   - Add a story/lore to the mod
   - more jokers, many with their own unique mechanics
   - more probably lol

All art and characters in the mod belong to/were created by me!
Code was made by me with help from... it's like 12am remind me to do this but its quite a few ppl. 

I love to hear ideas and suggestions :3
